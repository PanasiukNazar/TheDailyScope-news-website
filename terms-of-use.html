                    <p>You are not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You may not attempt to extract the app's source code, and you should not try to translate the app into other languages or create derivative versions. The app itself and all related trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights still belong to elmoiv.</p>
                    <p>elmoiv is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For this reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without clearly explaining what you are paying for.</p>
                    <p>The Redvid app stores and processes the personal data you provide to us to provide our service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and app access secure.</p>
                    <p>We recommend not jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by your device's official operating system. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone's security functions, and may result in the Redvid app not working correctly or at all.</p>
                    <p>The app uses third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
                    <p>Links to the Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Play Services</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en">AdMob</a></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things for which elmoiv will not take responsibility. Some features of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but elmoiv cannot take responsibility if the app does not function at full capacity if you do not have access to Wi-Fi and no more data is available.</p>
                    <p>If you are using the app outside an area with Wi-Fi, remember that the terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data during the connection while accessing the app or other third-party charges.</p>
                    <p>In using the app, you accept responsibility for such charges, including charges for data roaming if you use the app outside your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, be aware that we assume you have obtained permission from the bill payer to use the app.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, elmoiv cannot always take responsibility for how you use the app, i.e., you must ensure that your device remains charged - if the battery runs out and you cannot turn it on to avail the service, elmoiv cannot take responsibility.</p>
                    <p>Regarding elmoiv's liability for your use of the app, it is important to note that while we strive to ensure it is always up-to-date and accurate, we rely on third parties to provide us with information so that we can make it available to you.</p>
                    <p>elmoiv disclaims any liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you may suffer due to the complete reliability of this app feature. At some point, we may want to update the app. Currently, the app is available on Android and iOS - the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems to which we decide to extend the app's availability) may change, and you will need to download updates if you wish to continue using the app.</p>
                    <p>elmoiv does not promise to always update the app to make it relevant to you and/or compatible with the version of Android and iOS installed on your device.</p>
                    <p>However, you promise to always accept application updates when offered. We may also want to stop providing the app and may terminate use at any time without notice to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will terminate; (b) you must stop using the app and (if necessary) delete it from your device.</p>

                    <p>We may update our Terms and Conditions periodically. Therefore, we recommend reviewing this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.</p>
